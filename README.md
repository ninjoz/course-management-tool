# Course Management Tool

This application implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, specifically the topological sort method, for scheduling courses based on their prerequisites.

## Live Demo

To access the live demo of the application, click [here](https://ninjoz.github.io/course-management-tool/).

## Description

The application allows users to schedule courses by considering their prerequisites. It utilizes the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the course dependencies and determine the optimal order of courses to take.

## Features

1. **Course Data Input Method:**
   - Users can input course data and their prerequisites easily through the application interface.

2. **Data Simulation:**
   - The application provides simulation features for the input data, including:
     - Visualization of the input data using the D3 Force Directed Layout Graph.
     - DFS traversal on the input data to analyze dependencies.

3. **Optimized Course Schedule:**
   - The application calculates and presents the correct order of courses based on their prerequisites, ensuring an optimized course schedule.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (including D3.js for graph visualization)
- SVG for animations and graph rendering

## Usage

To use the application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Input course data and their prerequisites.
4. Explore the simulation features and visualize the course dependencies.
5. Click on the "Simulation" button to generate the optimal course schedule.
